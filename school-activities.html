                                <p>My first-ever activity involvement at Bukidnon State University as a freshman was memorable. I felt genuinely welcomed at the university. There were many booths to visit, and it was a lot of fun that my friends and I really enjoyed.</p>

                            <p>The first orientation, as a freshman, for BSIT and EMC all year levels was short and fun. This event also marked the opening of the 'twinning' booth. So, the two people beside me, the one wearing a grey and black shirt, and I decided to have matching outfits.</p>

                        <p>The SSS general assembly was a lot of fun. Various events took place during the assembly, and my favorite was the icebreaker. It was especially enjoyable because my friend participated in the game, and it turned out to be hilarious.</p>

                          <p>This marks my initial experience in the auditorium of Bukidnon State University. The assembly was entertaining, especially when it was time for all of us to stand up and dance to the Gummy Bear song. This was also the time when we had our pictures taken based on specialization and year level.</p>

                              <p>This event was quite nerve-wracking. The practice time was brief, and unfortunately, the rehearsal did not meet our expectations. Once again, I recognized how exhausting it can be to be one of the leaders. Nevertheless, it was still worthwhile because our instructor granted us an UNO, for which we are all very grateful.</p>
