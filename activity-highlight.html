                                <p>Certainly, will I ever forget the COT Acquaintance party? This ranks as my favorite school activity thus far. It was highly enjoyable, particularly when my friends and I had dinner outdoors. Finding a place to eat was a bit challenging as all the restaurants and fast-food joints were full. Fortunately, we managed to secure a spot in one of the fast-food places for our dinner. While our initial plan didn't unfold as expected, overall, it was still a fun experience. If given the chance to go back, I would gladly repeat this event.</p>
